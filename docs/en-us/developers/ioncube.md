# ionCube Loader

ionCube is a technology that protects PHP code from being read or copied. Developers compile their PHP scripts into encrypted bytecode, which the **ionCube Loader** (a PHP extension) decrypts and executes on the server at runtime. It's commonly used to distribute and license commercial PHP applications without exposing the source code.

## Benefits

- **Security** — Encrypted code makes it much harder for attackers to inject malware or backdoors into core files.
- **Reliability** — Locked files guarantee you're running exactly the code the developer intended — no bugs from accidental edits.
- **Performance** — The optimised bytecode runs fast and has virtually no impact on your site's speed.

## Enable ionCube

You can enable the ionCube Loader from the **Developer Tools** panel.
